# Batch-Normalization-On-Iris-Dataset
:pushpin: What is Batch Normalization?

Batch Normalization is a supervised learning technique that converts interlayer outputs into of a neural network into a standard format, called normalizing.  This effectively 'resets' the distribution of the output of the previous layer to be more efficiently processed by the subsequent layer.

It helps enabling of every layer in the neural network to learn independently.

:pencil2:The best way to gain insights on the same will be trying it out on the very basic "Iris Dataset" to help understand the concepts better.
