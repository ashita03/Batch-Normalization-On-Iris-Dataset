# Batch-Normalization-On-Iris-Dataset
Batch Normalization is a supervised learning technique that converts interlayer outputs into of a neural network into a standard format, called normalizing.  This effectively 'resets' the distribution of the output of the previous layer to be more efficiently processed by the subsequent layer.
